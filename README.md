# Apparate
A simple application, designed to pull audio data from youtube and download it in .webm format. It's designed after a tabletop campaign I'm running, so that's where the theming comes from.

Written in Node.js with React and Electron.

## Installing from Source
1. Clone repo
2. Install NPM packages (npm install)
3. Start application (npm start)

## Binaries coming soon
